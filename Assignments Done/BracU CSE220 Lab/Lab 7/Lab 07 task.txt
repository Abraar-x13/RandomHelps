Task 1 on Key index Searching & Sorting (25 marks)
Create a KeyIndex class with the following properties :

Fields:

int [ ] k;

Description
An array of integers.

Note: You may maintain another global variable(java)/instance variable(python) if needed (but you can’t use more than one).

Constructor:(10 marks)
KeyIndex(int [ ]a)


Description:


This constructor takes an array of integers a and populates array k with the element in a as indices into k.

Note: make sure the build-up of your array k supports negative and non-distinct integers.
Methods:

search (int val)    (5 marks)
Description:
This method searches for the value val within the array and returns true if found or false otherwise.

sort ()             (10 marks)
Description:

This method will return the sorted form of the array that had been passed into the constructor.
NOTE: Create a tester class or write tester statements to check whether the methods in your KeyIndex class work properly. You need to submit both the classes as a part of your assignment.                                                           (5 marks)





Task 2 on Hashing (15 marks)

 Given an array containing Strings, you need to write a code to store them in a hashtable. Assume that the Strings contain a combination of capital letters and numbers, and the String array will contain no more than 9 values.Use the hash function to be the
 (total number of consonants*24 + summation of the digits) %9. In case of a collision, use linear probing.
For a String “ST1E89B8A32”, it’s hash function will produce the value=(3*24+(1+8+9+8+3+2))%9=4, hence it will be stored in index 4 of the hash table.

Marks distribution:
Hash function calculation, method properly written =10 marks
Linear probing properly implemented= 5 marks
