The function matrix_multiplication(A, B, dimension) has a
time complexity of O(dimension^3) and it takes auxiliary
space of O(dimension^2). explanation -

Time Complexity :
    for i in range(0, dimension):
        for j in range(0, dimension):
            for k in range(0, dimension):
                multiply() # multiples A[i][k] and B[k][j] and keeps in C[i][j]
            end
        end
    end
    Here, the multiply() funtion runs i*j*k = dimention^3 times, thus the complexity.

Space Complexity :
    # Initialize C as a nxn zero matrix. (the outpput)
    C = [[0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0]]
    The C is a dimention*dimention list, where dimention = len(C[0])
    thus aux space = O(dimension^2).
