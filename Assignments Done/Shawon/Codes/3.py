    We have to check the parity of 4 numbers:
    { 'a' : "01001010", 'b' : "11011011", 'c' : "00110101", 'd' : "00101010"}
    for a, there are 3 ones in the binary form. Thus, it has odd parity.
    for b, there are 6 ones in the binary form. Thus, it has even parity.
    for c, there are 4 ones in the binary form. Thus, it has even parity.
    for d, there are 3 ones in the binary form. Thus, it has odd parity.
